1.	Get the Data
•	To get the data, visit any public domain and select a dataset type. 
•	Download it as csv or excel file.
For this walk through I used a dataset from following link. It shows the average Salary of a Java Developer with reference to their number of experiences.
https://github.com/kaveenhyacinth/Salary-vs-Experience-Prediction-SLR/blob/master/Salary_Data.csv

In the dataset I have downloaded, the number of years of experience is an independent variable i.e.X
whereas, the dependent variable is the Salary. i.e. Y.
